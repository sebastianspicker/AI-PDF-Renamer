# AI-PDF-Renamer
This repo provides a Py-tool that reads PDFs, extracts their text, classifies, summarizes the content via a local LLM and heuristic rules, and then automatically renames the files with meaningful, token-based filenames. It supports chunking for large documents, meta-word filtering, and customizable regex-based scoring for improved categorization.
