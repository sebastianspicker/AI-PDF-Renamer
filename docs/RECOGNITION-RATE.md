# Recognition rate: leading logic and improvements

Overview: **Who is leading (heuristic vs LLM)?** When does the heuristic apply? Use of **Qwen-8B-128K** and further ways to improve recognition rate.

## 1. Who is leading? Category decision tree

**Order of checks** (in `combine_categories` and the renamer):

| # | Condition | Leading | Note |
|---|-----------|--------|------|
| 0 | `override_category` set (CLI) | **Override** | Manually chosen category; no LLM call for category (summary/keywords still run). |
| 1 | Heuristic = `unknown` | **LLM** | No heuristic suggestion; normalized LLM category is used (if not document/na/unknown). |
| 2 | Heuristic score < `min_heuristic_score` | **LLM** | Heuristic treated as too weak. CLI: `--min-heuristic-score T`. |
| 3 | LLM = `unknown`/`na`/`document`/empty | **Heuristic** | LLM yields nothing useful; heuristic wins. |
| 4 | **High-confidence override** active | **Heuristic** | Score ≥ S and gap ≥ G → force heuristic. CLI: `--heuristic-override-min-score S`, `--heuristic-override-min-gap G`. |
| 5 | **Agreement** (exact or parent/sibling) | **Heuristic** | Same category or parent–child/sibling → heuristic form is used (consistent vocabulary). |
| 6 | **Conflict** (LLM ≠ heuristic) | **Overlap or prefer_llm** | See below. |

**On conflict (LLM ≠ heuristic):**

- **Keyword overlap on** (default):  
  Overlap of category tokens with (summary + keywords).  
  Weighted: `overlap_heur + heuristic_score_weight * heuristic_score` vs `overlap_llm`.  
  → Higher value wins; **tie → heuristic**.
- **Overlap off** or no context:  
  `prefer_llm=True` (default) → **LLM**; `--prefer-heuristic` → **Heuristic**.

**Summary:** Default is “LLM leading, heuristic supports” (fills gaps, suggests, overlap resolves conflicts). Heuristic leads when: override, LLM unknown/empty, high-confidence override, agreement, or overlap tie / overlap favours heuristic.

---

## 2. When does the heuristic actually apply?

- **Always:** The heuristic is **always** computed first (on PDF text, or only the first N characters for long documents).
- **Skip LLM:** When **both** are set: `--skip-llm-if-heuristic-score-ge S` and `--skip-llm-if-heuristic-gap-ge G`, **and** heuristic ≠ unknown, score ≥ S, gap ≥ G → **no** LLM call for category; `cat_llm` is set to `cat_heur`. Saves latency/cost; heuristic is then de facto the only source for category.
- **Text used for heuristic:**
  - `--heuristic-leading-chars N` (N>0): only first N characters.
  - Else: `len(content) >= heuristic_long_doc_chars_threshold` (default 40 000) → only first `heuristic_long_doc_leading_chars` (default 12 000).
  - Else: full text.

So the heuristic “applies” as: (1) suggestion to the LLM (top-N / allowed list), (2) result when LLM is unknown/empty, override, agreement, or skip-LLM, (3) in conflict via overlap or prefer_llm.

## 3. Qwen-8B-128K: current usage

- **PDF text:** `pdf_extract` caps at ~120 000 tokens (`CONTEXT_128K_MAX_CONTENT_TOKENS`); beyond that, text is truncated.
- **Summary:** Up to ~480k characters (~120k tokens) a single LLM call; above that, chunking (100k chars, 5k overlap), then a final summary from partial summaries.
- **Category/keywords:** The LLM sees only **summary + keywords**, not the full PDF text. The 128k context helps mainly for **summary** on long PDFs (fewer chunks or larger single-shot texts).

**Implication:** The LLM’s category decision is based on compressed information (summary + keywords). The heuristic uses (possibly truncated) raw text—so for clear patterns (e.g. “Rechnung”, “Lohnabrechnung”) the heuristic can often be more stable.

**Single-shot vs chunking:** For Qwen-8B-128K, PDFs whose extracted text stays below ~480k characters (~120k tokens) use a single summary call; only longer documents are chunked (100k chars per chunk, 5k overlap) and then summarized again. Most typical business PDFs therefore never trigger chunking.

## 4. Concrete improvements derived from behaviour

The following improvements are derived directly from how the pipeline works and where it is weak or underspecified.

### 4.1 Category: make heuristic lead when it is clearly right

- **Observation:** The LLM never sees full PDF text for category; it only sees summary + keywords. For document types with strong lexical cues (invoice, payslip, contract), the heuristic sees those cues in raw text and can be more reliable.
- **Improvement A – Skip-LLM defaults:** Document or add optional defaults that skip the LLM category call when the heuristic is confident, e.g. `--skip-llm-if-heuristic-score-ge 0.5 --skip-llm-if-heuristic-gap-ge 0.3`. This reduces wrong overrides by the LLM when the heuristic is already unambiguous. *Concrete:* add a RUNBOOK “recommended for high-volume clear document types” snippet and/or a preset (e.g. `--preset high-confidence-heuristic` that sets these two plus optional override thresholds).
- **Improvement B – High-confidence override defaults:** When heuristic score and gap are above thresholds, the code already forces heuristic over LLM. Today both options are `None` by default, so this never triggers unless the user sets them. *Concrete:* either document recommended values (e.g. 0.6 / 0.35) in RUNBOOK and RECOGNITION-RATE, or introduce non-None defaults (e.g. 0.55 and 0.3) so that very clear heuristic wins even if the LLM disagrees.

### 4.2 Category: reduce false conflicts via overlap and vocabulary

- **Observation:** Conflicts are resolved by token overlap of category names with (summary + keywords). If the LLM returns a synonym or typo that is not in the alias list, we get a false conflict and then rely on overlap or prefer_llm.
- **Improvement C – More category aliases:** Every LLM/OCR variant that maps to the same canonical category reduces false conflicts. *Concrete:* extend `category_aliases.json` with systematic typo/OCR variants (e.g. “rechung”, “vertag”, “abrechnug”, “invoce”, “reciept”) and optionally derive a small set from heuristic pattern tokens (with manual review) so vocabulary stays aligned.
- **Improvement D – Heuristic score weight in overlap:** The overlap comparison uses `overlap_heur + heuristic_score_weight * heuristic_score` (default weight 0.1). For strong heuristic scores, a higher weight (e.g. 0.2) makes the heuristic more likely to win on conflict without changing the rest of the logic. *Concrete:* document in RUNBOOK that increasing `--heuristic-score-weight` (e.g. to 0.2) favours heuristic when both overlap and score are considered; optionally raise default from 0.1 to 0.15.

### 4.3 Category: focus heuristic on the informative part of the document

- **Observation:** Long documents mix many themes (e.g. cover letter + contract + appendix). Heuristic scores accumulate over the full text (or first N chars); footer/boilerplate can dilute the true document type.
- **Improvement E – Title region by default:** When the document type is usually in the first pages, weighting the first N characters (e.g. 2000–4000) reduces noise. *Concrete:* document `--title-weight-region 2000 --title-weight-factor 1.5` (or 2.0) as a recommended option for “document type in header/title”; consider non-zero default for `title_weight_region` (e.g. 2000) so short headers are favoured unless the user disables it.
- **Improvement F – Long-doc leading (documented):** For long docs (≥40k chars), only the first 12k chars are used for heuristic. For very long PDFs, lowering `--heuristic-long-doc-leading` (e.g. to 8000) can further focus on the beginning if the type is declared early. See RUNBOOK.

### 4.4 Date: prefer document date over footer/page dates

- **Observation:** Dates are extracted from the full text (or first N chars if `date_prefer_leading_chars` is set). Footers and page numbers often contain print/version dates that can override the real document date.
- **Improvement G – Date leading chars by default:** For typical business documents, the document date is in the header or first page. *Concrete:* document `--date-prefer-leading-chars 8000` (or 10000) as the recommended option; consider a non-zero default (e.g. 8000) so that the first 8k characters are searched first and the first valid date there wins, reducing footer-date wins.
- **Improvement H – More date patterns:** Add patterns in `text_utils` for common labels, e.g. “Erstellt: DD.MM.YYYY”, “Datum Rechnung: …”, “Invoice date:”, “Document date:”, so that explicitly labelled dates are found more reliably.

### 4.5 LLM (Qwen-8B-128K): summary quality and doc-type hint

- **Observation:** Category and keywords are derived from summary + keywords. If the summary does not state the document type clearly, the LLM’s category can drift; for chunked long docs, the final summary is built from partial summaries and may lose the “document type” emphasis.
- **Improvement I – Doc-type in chunked summary aggregation:** When `suggested_doc_type` is set and the document is chunked, the final aggregation prompt could include: “The document was heuristically classified as [type]. Ensure the combined summary reflects this document type.” *Concrete:* in `llm.get_document_summary`, when building `final_prompt` for the chunked path, append the same doc-type hint used in chunk prompts so the final 1–2 sentence summary consistently emphasises type.
- **Improvement J – Keep single-shot below 128K:** The current single-shot limit (~480k chars) and chunk sizes are already aligned with 128k tokens. No code change; document in RECOGNITION-RATE or PERFORMANCE that for Qwen-128K, only PDFs whose extracted text exceeds that size use chunking, so most documents get a single summary call.

### 4.6 PDF extraction and length

- **Observation:** Very long PDFs (e.g. catalogues, multi-document packs) can push the heuristic and the summary toward “noisiest” or generic content; the true type is often in the first few pages.
- **Improvement K – Max pages as tuning knob:** `--max-pages-for-extraction N` (e.g. 30 or 50) limits extraction to the first N pages. *Concrete:* document in RUNBOOK that for mixed or very long PDFs, setting `--max-pages-for-extraction 50` (or lower) can improve recognition by focusing on the main body and avoiding appendix/boilerplate.

### 4.7 Observability and tuning

- **Observation:** `CategorySource source=heuristic|llm|combined|override` and `CategoryConflict chosen=...` logs show who decided and when heuristic and LLM disagreed. Without analysing these, it is hard to tune thresholds and aliases.
- **Improvement L – Log analysis guidance:** In RECOGNITION-RATE or RUNBOOK, add a short “Tuning” subsection: (1) run with INFO logging; (2) grep for `CategoryConflict` to see frequent (llm, heuristic) pairs; (3) add aliases for LLM outputs that should map to heuristic category, or adjust override/skip-LLM thresholds; (4) use `CategorySource` to see ratio heuristic vs llm vs combined and decide whether to strengthen heuristic (e.g. skip-LLM, override, score weight) or leave LLM leading.

### 4.8 Summary of concrete actions

| ID | Area | Concrete action |
|----|------|-----------------|
| A | Skip-LLM | Document or add preset for `--skip-llm-if-heuristic-score-ge 0.5 --skip-llm-if-heuristic-gap-ge 0.3`. |
| B | Override | Document or set default `heuristic_override_min_score` / `heuristic_override_min_gap` (e.g. 0.55, 0.3). |
| C | Aliases | Add typo/OCR variants to `category_aliases.json`; optionally derive some from heuristic patterns. |
| D | Overlap weight | Document or raise default `heuristic_score_weight` (e.g. 0.15 or 0.2). |
| E | Title region | Document or set default `title_weight_region` (e.g. 2000) and `title_weight_factor` (e.g. 1.5). |
| F | Long-doc | Document tuning of `--heuristic-long-doc-leading` for long PDFs. |
| G | Date leading | Document or set default `date_prefer_leading_chars` (e.g. 8000). |

## 5. Tuning (quick reference)

1. Run with INFO logging.  
2. Grep `CategoryConflict` → add aliases for frequent LLM outputs.  
3. Tune skip-LLM / override thresholds or use `--preset high-confidence-heuristic`.  
4. Use `CategorySource` ratio (heuristic vs llm vs combined) to decide whether to strengthen heuristic (score weight, override) or leave LLM leading.  
Details: §6.

## 6. Tuning using logs

Use runtime logs to tune aliases and thresholds:

1. **Run with INFO logging** so that `CategorySource` and `CategoryConflict` lines are emitted.
2. **Inspect conflicts:** Grep for `CategoryConflict` to see frequent (llm, heuristic) pairs. If the LLM often returns a synonym or typo that should map to the heuristic category, add that string to `category_aliases.json` (key = normalized LLM output, value = heuristic category).
3. **Adjust thresholds:** If the heuristic is often right but the LLM overrides it, consider `--skip-llm-if-heuristic-score-ge` / `--skip-llm-if-heuristic-gap-ge` or `--preset high-confidence-heuristic`; if the heuristic is too weak, lower `--heuristic-override-min-score` / `--heuristic-override-min-gap` or use `--no-heuristic-override` to rely more on the LLM.
4. **CategorySource ratio:** Use `CategorySource source=heuristic|llm|combined|override` to see how often the category comes from heuristic only, LLM only, or both. A high share of `combined` with many conflicts may warrant more aliases or a higher `--heuristic-score-weight`.

## 7. Summary

- **Leading:** Default is LLM on conflict (with overlap resolution). Heuristic leads when: override, LLM unknown/empty, high-confidence override, agreement, or skip-LLM (no LLM category call then).
- **When heuristic applies:** Always as first estimate; as the result when LLM is missing/unknown, on override/agreement/skip-LLM/overlap tie, or when overlap/config favours heuristic.
- **128K:** Used for long PDFs in summary (single-shot up to ~480k chars, else chunking); category/keywords are based on summary + keywords, not full text.
- **Improvements:** The table in §4.8 lists concrete, derived improvements (defaults, aliases, date patterns, doc-type in chunked summary, and log-based tuning).
